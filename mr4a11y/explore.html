              <h3>National Center for Distance Education</h3>
              <p aria-expanded="false">
                The CNED (Centre national d'enseignement à distance) is probably the largest public establishment of the
                Ministry of National Education in terms of distance education. Since 1939, it has offered a
                correspondence education service to meet the needs of the country which has just entered the Second
                World War.
                <br>
                It was in 1997 that the CNED entered the Internet. The digital establishment obviously becomes an asset
                for people with disabilities. Indeed, whether for problems due directly to the establishment (unsuitable
                structure, missing accompanying staff, etc.) or for external problems (transport to the establishment,
                for example), schools are not yet today, not always accessible.
                <br>
                Even more so today, with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to have access to an accessible work
                environment and courses.

                    alt="The keys of the success"></span>
                In 2013, the CNED signed an agreement with the FIPHFP (Fund for the integration of people with
                disabilities in the public service) to make their site accessible to everyone, teachers and students. On
                September 3, 2021, the date of the last update of their accessibility statement, the site met 75% of the
                RGAA version 4.1 criteria for parties without a personal space and only 59% for connected parties. This
                is an important point to settle in order to guarantee the same chances of success for everyone. It can
                be noted that each year, the site updates its declaration and that they continue their action plan for
                accessibility.

              <h3>How Mixed Reality can Help Disabled People</h3>
              <div aria-expanded="false">
                There are many ways through which mixed reality can potentially help the disabled.
                According to researchers and other technology experts, it is possible to use mixed reality to improve
                the quality of life for disabled people.
                <ol class="list">
                  <li>Education</li>
                  Researchers have recently used virtual reality training programs to teach autistic children how to
                  cross the roads safely. The research showed that after a month-long exercise, researchers established
                  that virtual reality training significantly improved the ability of the children to cross the road.
                  <li>Navigating</li>
                  It is often complex, when visiting new places, for physically disabled people to navigate or find
                  their ways around a city. Virtual reality can help provide a simulated environment of the city and
                  thus allow the disabled individual to have a feel of the city and get used to the most accessible
                  routes to use.
                  <li>Muscle Recovery</li>
                  Virtual reality is also useful in helping people who have suffered from strokes or sports-related
                  injuries and even vestibular system issues to improve their motor skills and help in muscle recovery.
                  According to research even the act of imagining that one is performing an activity is enough to
                  stimulate the relevant parts of the brain needed to perform the activity.
                  <li>Low Vision</li>
                  Some conditions such as Stargardt’s disease can lead to visual impairment in the form of reduced
                  central detailed vision. However, research has established that it is possible to use VR to help
                  people with such visual disabilities see images with greater clarity.
