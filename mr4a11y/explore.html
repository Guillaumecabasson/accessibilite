              <h3>National Center for Distance Education</h3>
              <p aria-expanded="false">
                The CNED (Centre national d'enseignement à distance) is probably the largest public establishment of the
                Ministry of National Education in terms of distance education. Since 1939, it has offered a
                correspondence education service to meet the needs of the country which has just entered the Second
                World War.
                <br>
                It was in 1997 that the CNED entered the Internet. The digital establishment obviously becomes an asset
                for people with disabilities. Indeed, whether for problems due directly to the establishment (unsuitable
                structure, missing accompanying staff, etc.) or for external problems (transport to the establishment,
                for example), schools are not yet today, not always accessible.
                <br>
                Even more so today, with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to have access to an accessible work
                environment and courses.
                <span id="img"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/cles_de_la_reussite.png"
                    alt="The keys of the success"></span>
                In 2013, the CNED signed an agreement with the FIPHFP (Fund for the integration of people with
                disabilities in the public service) to make their site accessible to everyone, teachers and students. On
                September 3, 2021, the date of the last update of their accessibility statement, the site met 75% of the
                RGAA version 4.1 criteria for parties without a personal space and only 59% for connected parties. This
                is an important point to settle in order to guarantee the same chances of success for everyone. It can
                be noted that each year, the site updates its declaration and that they continue their action plan for
                accessibility.

              <h3>The EyeSchool Project</h3>
              <div aria-expanded="false">
                To quote them, EyeSchool is “the first nomadic digital device for access to reading, writing and note
                taking for people with sensory disabilities or students with severe language disorders (Dys) in an
                educational course and vocational training.”
                <br>
                This device facilitates access to information written on the board as well as note taking. It consists
                of a laptop, a very small scanner, a camera and a digital capture bar attached to the board.
                <span id="img"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/access_school.png"
                    alt="The accessible school"></span>
                <br>
                The camera films the painting or any element that the student cannot see and displays it on the computer
                screen by zooming or adapting it according to the child's needs (inversion of colors, increase contrasts
                etc). The scanner makes it possible to transcribe any paper document on the computer, allowing the
                previously mentioned functionalities but also reading by a voice synthesizer. The Portanum vision
                assistance software, originally designed by Thales Mission Insertion, also has a vocalized menu allowing
                the use of EyeSchool by the blind. The digital capture bar is used to capture the movements of the
                writing hand and transcribe them on the student's computer.
                <br>
                This system is of paramount importance for the education of students with disabilities. Indeed, it could
                allow these children to study with all the others without the need for constant assistance. EyeSchool
                has been on the market since 2014.
